      <blockquote-1>A Shepherd Boy tended his master's Sheep near
        a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life
        in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself
        was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe. One day as
        he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest,
        and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf,
        he thought of a plan to amuse himself.</blockquote-1>

      <blockquote-2>His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf!"</blockquote-2>

      <blockquote-3>As he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them.</blockquote-3>
