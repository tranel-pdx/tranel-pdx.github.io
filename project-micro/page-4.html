    <h1>Why Do Microaggressions Matter?</h1>
    <ol>
      <h2>Micro-aggressions (simplified)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Statements or behaviors, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile,
          derogatory, or negative slights and insults based on race and other social identities. Remember
          to focus on impact not intent. We can have good intentions yet cause harm in  the process through
          language, behavior and assumptions (to name a few). They occur in the classroom, workplace and day-to-day life.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h2>There are different levels:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Micro-assaults (often conscious) – Explicit racial comments meant to hurt the intended victim through name calling, avoidant behavior or purposeful discriminatory actions</li>
          <li>Micro-insults (unconscious) – Behaviors or comments that convey rudeness, insensitivity, and demean a person’s heritage or identity</li>
          <li>Micro-invalidation (often unconscious) – Comments or behaviors that exclude, negate or nullify the thoughts, feelings or experiences of a person of color</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>They impact mental health:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Research indicates that experiencing large amounts of microaggressions lead to distress, anxiety, depression and physical issues </li>
        </ul>
      <h2>The harmful impact of microaggressions:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Many are subtle and escape recognition by both the perpetrator and target.</li>
          <li>Make people feel excluded, like second class citizens and sometimes unsafe.</li>
          <li>Over the course of time microaggressions lead to mental and physical health issues.</li>
          <li>Affect retention of students, staff and faculty of color.</li>
          <li>Microaggressions can interact across other identities (gender, race, ability, religion, sexual orientation, immigration status, social class, age….etc)</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
